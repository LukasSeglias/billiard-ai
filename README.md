System designed to help a billiard player find the best next strike.

This project is the result of our Bachelor's Thesis at [BFH TI](https://www.bfh.ch/ti/en/).

## Features
- Real-time billiard situation recognition and tracking using image processing.
- Cost-based billiard strike search using artificial intelligence over multiple breaks.
- Event-driven analytical simulation and playback animation.
- Interactive search and suggestions during play.
